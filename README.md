# homebridge-midea

[![Donate](https://img.shields.io/badge/Donate-PayPal-green.svg)](https://paypal.me/TobiasTimpe) â€“ In case you want to support my work :)

Homebridge plugin to control Midea AC units. Still in early development.


## Configuration

Add this to the platforms array in your config.json:

	{
	    "platform": "midea",
	    "user": "MIDEA_ACCOUNT_EMAIL",
	    "password": "MIDEA_PASSWORD",
	    "interval": 1,
	    "devices": [
	    	{
	    		"deviceId": "DEVICE_ID",
	    		"supportedSwingMode": "Vertical",
				  "temperatureSteps": 1,
				  "fanOnlyMode": true,
				  "fanOnlyModeName": "Fan Only Mode"
	    	}
	    ]
	}

## Optional per-device Configuration Values

To set specific per-device values, be sure to first look into the Home app to find your deviceId and use it as the key in the ```devices``` object

### supportedSwingMode

"Off", "Vertical", "Horizontal", "Both"
You have to select which type your device supports


### temperatureSteps

Temperature steps that the device supports. Default is 0.5

### fanOnlyMode & fanOnlyModeName

This allows you to enable a fan-only mode service


## Usage

Rotation Speed/Swing mode can set in the homekit device when you swipe up tp the device settings.
Rotation Speed values are:
0 : device off
-25%: Low 
-50%: Middle
-75%: High
-100%: Auto


## Notes

This version of ```homebridge-midea``` is a platform and should be able to access all device in the user's account. However, many devices may not be supported or function incorrectly. This is due to the lack of documentation of the raw MSmart API. If you encounter any problems, please open a new issue and specify your device model.


## Credits
This plugin would not have been possible without the fundamentals that the Midea iobroker plugin and all of the other Midea API clients in Ruby and Python provided.


## Development
Make changes only on the `src` folder. To build, make sure you have TypeScript installed (already in the devDependencies of package.json) and run `tsc --build tsconfig.json`
To deploy in homebridge, simply run `npm link` in this folder.
